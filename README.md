How to plan ahead my variables before jumping in the code. How to analyze the design and build a system with colors, font-weights, spacing that allow me to quickly build the layout and update it.

### Continued development

Dig further in scss functions, extends and mixins. Keep working on the variable naming system to make it transferable easily between projects.
